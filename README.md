# Boilerplate with Webpack React and SCSS

Project boilerplate using webpack, react, sass, autoprefixer and the 7-1 sass styling architecture.

The idea for this project was to make my own custom starting point for current and future projects and learn more about webpack. I decided to stick with scss with this boilerplate rather than using postcss. The scss scturcture is using the 7-1 architecture and was mostly borrowed from:

To begin the project run:

`yarn install` for dependencies

`yarn build` builds out the production directory in "public"

`yarn start` starts up the webpack dev server for development
